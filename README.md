# GA Index

## Summary
- GA Index is a directory for General Assembly alumni community where they can find each other. For this project, I created separate front end and back end.
- For the front end, I used React and it is hosted on Amazon S3.
- The back end was created using Ruby on Rails and it is hosted on Heroku.
- I also used the LinkedIn API for signing in.


### Online version

### Background and objective of the application:
- GA Index allows students to find students from different cohorts or who have graduated in the past.
- Each student's information is available to all users of the application.     

### Description of the app:
* This repository includes only the front-end of the application, for the back-end code review the repository final_project_backend.
* The home page includes a short description of the application and a button to sign in using LinkedIn.
* The user is redirected to an authorisation page, where she/he must allow access to the app.
* After user is granted, a user will be automatically created in the system.
* A profile is created for the user, and the photo and summary from LinkedIn is used.
* Users can edit their profile by clicking on the navigation menu. Users can select a cohort, edit their summary, skills, interests, LinkedIn url, Github url, Facebook url and website.
* Users' profiles can be filtered by Cohort
